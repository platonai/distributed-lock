= Example application

This application will create a REST endpoint `/hello/{name}` which will call a JDBC locked service.
The locks are kept in a H2 in-memory database.

Each time a lock is created in the database, a trigger will be fired and create a new log entry.
This is purely to show that locks are correctly inserted into the database.
